# Resume Template

My resume template written in HTML and CSS. There are different versions. If you're opening it in the container folder, double left click on the html should open it in your default browser. If you're in an IDE, you just have to right click the html file, "COPY FULL PATH" and then paste it into your browser to open the html.

# How to save as PDF

Press CTRL+P or CMD+P to open the print dialog. Change the destination printer to "Save as PDF". You may need to customize the margins.

I've attached my resume.
